   <h3>Abstract</h3>

   <p>Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the infrastructure of connected physical devices which is
    growing at a rapid rate, as huge number of common use devices and gadgets are getting
    enabled with Internet connectivity. IoT is shifting gears of the future generation automation
    technology. The mobility and ease of remote access is making IoT a go-to-technology for
    commercial and domestic digital transformation. IoT has virtually captured every sector of
    concern, from healthcare to defense, acting as a game changer in making the world more
    connected and secured. One such vital application of IoT technology is Home security.
    We are using it to create an inexpensive security system for domestic and for industrial
    purposes as well.. The proposed system named - ‚ÄúSmart Home Security System‚Äù will
    alert the owner/owners about any unauthorized access to home premises or whenever the
    entry points of home is operated, by sending a notification over email and WhatsApp
    respectively. After receiving the notification, the user can take the necessary security
    actions. To enable the functioning of seamless communication channel that will be immune
    to illicit interception, API based software solution for e-mail and WhatsApp alert is
    implemented. The security system uses a popular microcontroller unit, Arduino Uno as a
    host to act as an interface between the components, an optic PIR sensor to monitor the
    status, Bluetooth speaker for sounding the alarm, and a Wi-Fi module (ESP8266) to
    connect and communicate using the Internet. The major advantages of such a system
    includes the ease of installation and setup, lower costs and greater versatility of the system
    suitable for outdoor conditions. The components required to build the system is cost
    effective and easily available thus reducing the time taken to resolve hardware failure
    issues (if required). This is particularly important because home security system is a basic
    need that demands round the clock vigilance and efficiency to serve its prime purpose.

    <h3> Working Model</h3>

<p>The proposed project is a collective interfacing of ESP8266, a voice module and a PIR
    sensor together with a microcontroller (Arduino). The ESP8266 module is a small module
    that allows microcontrollers to connect to a Wi-Fi network and make simple TCP/IP
    connections .The ESP8266 (with 1 MiB of built-in flash), allows the devices to be capable
    of connecting to Wifi.This module is connected with a PIR sensor (an electronic sensor),
    that measures infrared (IR) light radiating from objects in its field of view. It is most often
    used in PIR-based motion detectors. PIR sensors are generally used in security alarms
    and automatic lighting applications. PIR sensors detect general movement, but do not give
    information on who or what moved. For that purpose, an active IR sensor is required. The
    output data received from the PIR is sent to the cloud with the help of Arduino, where the
    data is stored and is sent directly to the host on his e-mail address. Arduino, which is a
    microcontroller board, is equipped with sets of digital and analog input/output pins the may
    be interfaced to various extension boards and other circuits. The board has 14 digital I/O
    pins, 6 analog I/O pins, and is programmable with the Arduino IDE (Integrated
    Development Environment ), via Type B USB cable. With the help of Arduino‚Äôs input
    output pins, all the other equipments are connected and UNO board is programmed in
    such a way, that it interfaces all the other equipments and sends data to the cloud.
    The data received from the microcontroller will inform the host about the intrusion
    (movement) inside his home. All the data will be captured by the PIR sensor and a Voice
    
    Recognition Module, which is a easy-control speaking recognition board. It is a speaker-
    dependent module and supports up to 80 voice commands. Any sound which we want to
    
    set as an alarming sound could be trained as a command, if the user wants to display that
    command when any intrusion occurs within the house . This project is a user friendly
    device and is a must need device for every house. The notification feature makes it very
    instant for the host to take necessary actions to prevent burglary in his house.</p>

   <h3>Concluson</h3>


<p>A smart home contains a connection between wireless communication, sensors,
    monitoring and tracking. Smart homes are systems that include multiple technologies and
    applications that can be used to provide security and control of the home easily. The
    project has proposed the idea of Smart homes that can support a lot of home automation
    systems. From our project, ‚ÄúSMART HOME SECURITY SYSTEM‚Äù, we have learnt about
    one of the recent technologies, which is IOT (Internet Of Things), a system of interrelated
    computing devices, provided with unique identifiers (UIDs) and the ability to transfer data
    over a network. Not only this, we have also learnt about various equipments like ESP8266
    (a Wifi Module), PIR sensor, Voice module and many others and their working. Smart
    Home Security System is one of the projects in which we built a security system which
    triggers an Email response on detecting any intrusion in the house. The proposed project
    is a fully functional Security system which can be armed/ disarmed (activated/ deactivated)
    remotely via the internet. One can even record our own audio clip which will be played
    when movements are detected and also send a mail with date and time to a particular
    Email ID stating the intrusion. This project helps people to be aware of any kind of intrusion
    inside their homes.</p>

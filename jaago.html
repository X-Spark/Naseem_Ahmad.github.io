   <h2>Abstract</h2>

   <p>During night, on the highways, the truck drivers feel drowsy, which in turn causes various accid
    ents. To prevent this, “JAAGO” , a road safety device should be installed, so that the drivers come 
    back to their senses and accidents are prevented. “JAAGO”  is an Pervasive Computing based product which takes continuous
     pictures of the driver’s face every 5-6 seconds, detecting the features of drowsiness. It sounds an 
     alarm and sprinkles some water (a water sprinkler will also be attached) so that the driver might come
      back to his senses. “JAAGO” is also connected to the indicating lights of the truck, which would start
       blinking as soon as the features of drowsiness are detected, so that other drivers on the road get 
       attentive, which might help prevent any accidents from occurring. JAAGO is a revolutionary product, 
       which makes India less prone to night accidents happening due to the drowsiness of truck drivers on
        highways at night.
    </p>



        <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
      <p>This idea describes the prevention of accidents on highways at night due to the drowsiness of
           truck drivers. The main reason of this being the overworked and underpaid truck drivers in India. 
           In order to earn bread for his family, these truck drivers remain sleepless for days, and drive through
            the busy highways even at night, which leads to loss of lives and resources.
        According to The National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA), 
        approximately 83,000 accidents, happening due to the drivers who actually doze off
         behind the wheels of their respective vehicles, are reported annually.  This includes 
         approximately 886 fatal crashes, 37,000 injury crashes, and 45,000 property damage crashes.
          Hence, it proves that it is even more difficult and dangerous for other drivers to be sharing 
          the road with these sleep deprived drivers at night on highways. [1]
        Driving at night is itself very dangerous because of the limited amount of light
         emulating from the headlights and streetlights. And, adding fatigued and sleep deprived drivers
          to it makes it even worse and dangerous.
        There are many existing technologies in the market which detects drowsiness of drivers and help preventing accidents at night.
         Although, what makes JAAGO different from those is the usage of Pervasive Computing based technology and Image processing together 
         with the water sprinkler and alarm system. This world is looking forward to adopt new technologies based on the requirements.
          Hence, in the proposed idea, a new technology has been proposed which takes continuous pictures of the driver’s face every
           5 to 6 seconds, and detects the features of drowsiness. As soon as it is detected, an alarm starts ringing, some water is
            sprinkled on the driver’s face, and the indicating lights of the truck starts blinking, so that other drivers’ in the vicinity 
            could be notified about the drowsy mind of the truck driver.
        </p>


            <h2> Working Model</h2>


            <h2 style="margin-bottom: 5px; font-size: 20px;">Logging in</h2> 
            <p>The user has to be able to log in in the program. 
            He has to sit in the position that he likes to sit in. Then he has to look at 
            the camera with his eyes opened normally. When the camera detected the eyes, 
            you can take the picture and agree with the program that the eyes are 
            normally open. If the eyes are not opened normally within the picture, 
            it should be possible to take a new picture in which the eyes are opened normally.</p>
           
            <h2 style="margin-bottom: 5px; font-size: 20px;">Choosing sound</h2> <p>In the user interface it should be possible to change the 
                sound of the alert. The user can play the sound, and then make his/her choice by selecting 
                the sound with a radiobutton.</p>

            <h2 style="margin-bottom: 5px; font-size: 20px;">Falling asleep</h2> <p>The user is logged in and driving the car that he has to drive, but he is slowly falling asleep.
                When his eyes are closed for a certain amount of seconds, suddenly the system will activate alarm & water sprinkles. 
                The driver wakes up and sees that the screen of his device is flickering with bright lights.
                 As fast as he can he control the truck & will prevent the accident.</p>
             
             <h2 style="margin-bottom: 5px; font-size: 20px;">Walking away</h2> <p>The driver should be able to walk away from his drawsiness detector,
                to get some snacks, water, opening the door and so on. The user should be able to click on a button
                 in the menu that says something like: ‘Break’. When the user clicks this button he can walk away from 
                 the computer. When the user walks away from his detector using this button, the alarm will not active.</p>

              <h2 style="margin-bottom: 5px; font-size: 20px;">Logging off</h2>
               <p> When the user is done driving, it should be possible for him to shut down the program.
                The system should not give alarms anymore. </p>



<h2> Future Scope & Impact </h2><p>JAAGO is a very advantageous product as it detects drowsiness
     by taking continuous pictures of the face of the driver. It is an environmental  friendly
      product because it causes no pollution to the environment. It doesn’t even require any specific 
      set-up space for its installation, and its maintenance cost is almost negligible. The drivers 
      don’t need to wear anything on their faces for JAAGO to work. It is the new way of  detecting 
      drowsiness and preventing accidents for the whole world.JAAGO is very much needed in today’s world 
      where the number of night accidents are increasing day by day. JAAGO gives security to the cargo, 
      to the truck and also to the truck drivers. Night travel is made easy due to this product, and the
       terror of accidents is also reduced. It is a solution to the driver’s drowsiness feeling. It’s impact
        to the Indian market will be huge because of its compact size, cheap price and functionality.JAAGO is

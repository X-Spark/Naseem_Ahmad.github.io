   <h2>Abstract</h2>
   <p>World population is increasing day by day
      [Ref: USCB] and so as the production and consumption
      of electricity[Ref: GESY 2017]. As a result of which,
      carbon emission in the atmosphere is also increasing.
      Hence, electricity crisis is a problem that the world has
      been facing due to the limited amount of natural
      resources available to us. So, the world needs to work
      with renewable sources of energy in order to overcome
      this energy crisis by not using any natural resources.
      Human beings are an asset, that earth wouldn’t be
      running out of anytime soon. So, to use human
      weight/pressure to generate electricity is the alternative
      solution that the world should summon up in order to
      walk in pace with the upcoming energy crisis. The name
      of the product is “X-Spark”. It is a renewable and green
      form of energy which generates electricity using human
      (and vehicle) pressure/ weight. X-Spark can be used as
      tiles and mats. The best part of X-Spark is that it does
      not consume any type of natural resources to generate
      electricity. It provides totally green and renewable
      energy. Hence, X-Spark fulfills the criteria’s mentioned
      above very well and proves to be the best solution.
      (“X-Spark” - available in the form of both tiles and mats
      to convert mechanical energy into electrical energy)</p>



        <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
      <p>This paper describes the generation of electricity using X-
         Spark (tiles or mats). When a human walks or a vehicle runs
         on the surface of a road, it exerts some pressure (energy) on
         the surface, which is actually getting wasted. X-Spark traps
         this energy (mechanical energy) and converts it into
         electrical energy, which is a green, sustainable and
         renewable form of energy.
         When a human walks, he exerts some pressure on the
         surface he is walking on. The surface is replaced with X-
         Spark (tiles). So, if floors of crowded places (like railway
         stations, airports, shopping malls, dance clubs or any place
         where the footstep count is more than normal) are replaced
         by X-Spark tiles, then that particular place do not need to
         buy electricity from any outside source. These places can
         generate electricity by themselves. In case of highways,
         where vehicles run in a continuous manner, X-Spark mat
         can be implemented. If we construct 1 km long X-Spark
         mat on a busy highway, then enough amount of electricity
         will be generated, with which street lights can be lighten
         up. The electricity can also be stored and supplied to the
         nearest villages and can be used for various other purposes
         as well.
         There are many existing technologies in the market like
         “PAVEGEN” [2], a London company, which is also
         providing energy from footsteps. Another innovation
         company known as “ParaGen” [3], also came up with the
         innovation of converting mechanical energy into electrical
         energy using tiles but both of these companies failed in this
         field due to their poor innovation technique and
         methodology. Both of these companies are unable to
         convert mechanical energy into electrical energy
         efficiently. And they have poor conversion rate. Hence, we
         have come up with a proper innovative technique and methodology to convert the mechanical energy into
         electrical energy using X-Spark (tiles and mats) which has
         a better conversion rate as compared to them.
         This world is looking forward to adopt some renewable
         energy sources to generate electricity like (solar, wind,
         hydro, etc.) but, all these renewable sources have specific
         limitations to generate electricity. So, if the world wants to
         switch to renewable sources to generate electricity by at
         least 50 percent by the year 2050 (Ref: IRENA), then a
         suitable alternative solution has to be adopted which have
         less limitations and disadvantages, and X-Spark fulfills this
         criteria very well.
         X-Spark is able to generate electricity from human pressure
         efficiently. But, what makes X-Spark different is its
         unique method and technique of converting human/ vehicle
         pressure into electricity which differs from any of the
         existing technologies.
         Some of the specific advantages of X-Spark are its no fuel
         input mechanism. X-Spark generates power merely by the
         vibration collected by walking of humans (or vehicles) on
         it. Hence, it does not require any extra material or
         maintenance cost (negligible). It is totally a pollution free
         product because it does not use any natural or
         non–renewable resources for the generation of energy. It
         doesn’t even require any specific set-up space for its
         installation. Moreover, after installation its free energy
         [i.e., after installation it doesn’t require a single penny
         (except some maintenance cost) to be spent on it in order to
         generate energy].</p>


            <h2>Impact & Future Scope</h2>


            <p>X-Spark (tiles and mats) is capable of generating energy by
               mere walking of humans or running of vehicles on it. The
               series/ parallel connection of the sensors (within X-Spark)
               is what makes it more compatible. The weight/ pressure
               applied on X-Spark is linearly related to the amount of
               power generated from it. It is to be especially implemented
               in crowded areas or at any place where the foot count is
               more than normal. The energy generated by X-Spark can
               be used to light up the street lights (without using the long
               power lines). It can also be used to light up a whole
               building or even a village. X-Spark proves to be an
               efficient, renewable, sustainable, clean and environmental
               friendly solution to the upcoming energy crisis, which the
               world is definitely going to face by the year 2050. In X-
               Spark, a unique technology and method is used, which
               makes it more efficient and better than the other existing
               products. A single X-spark tile can generate electricity up
               to 5 seconds with just the pressure of a single foot step. If
               regular and continuous walking pressure is exerted on these
               tiles, then one tile will be able to generate (15-125)
               watt/hrs. Hence, if (approximately 25000) X-Spark tiles are
               installed, it will be able to generate and provide (375-3125)
               KWh of energy to the load [Table 1].
               Since, utilization of the wasted energy is very much relevant
               and important for highly populated countries like INDIA,
               CHINA, BANGLADESH, etc., so, by replacing the normal
               tiles of a railway station, shopping mall or an airport by X-
               Spark tiles, huge amount of electricity will be generated.
               Humans walking on X-Spark tiles will exert pressure on it,
               resulting to the generation of power by the conversion of
               mechanical pressure into electrical energy. The amount of
               electricity generated will be sufficient for the whole railway
               station (or airport, shopping mall) to light up. More the
               crowd, more energy will be generated. This generated
               energy can even be stored in a battery for simultaneous or
               future use.
               By replacing the normal tiles of even a dance- club or a
               footpath (regular pathway for pedestrians) by X-Spark tiles,
               huge amount of electricity will be generated. Similarly, if X-
               Spark mats are implemented on busy highways, huge
               amount of electricity will be generated.
               X-Spark is a very advantageous product as it works on no
               fuel input mechanism. It generates energy merely by the
               vibration collected by walking of humans (or vehicles) on
               it. It is an environmental friendly product because it causes
               no pollution to the environment. It doesn’t even require any
               specific set-up space for its installation, and itsmaintenance cost is almost negligible. It is a renewable and
               green form of energy which generates electricity using
               human/ vehicle pressure/weight. It is the new way of
               generating electricity for the whole world.</p>
